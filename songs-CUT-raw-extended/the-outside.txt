Taylor Swift
2006

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason
I know I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
