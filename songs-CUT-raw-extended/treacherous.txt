Taylor Swift
2012

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it
