Taylor Swift
2006

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
