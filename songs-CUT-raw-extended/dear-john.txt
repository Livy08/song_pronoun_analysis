Taylor Swift
2010

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I should've known
