Taylor Swift 
2014

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up."
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love
