Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I'll say, "Just fine."
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I'll love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
