Taylor Swift
2012

Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I keep my life in black and blue
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I had to do, ooh yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
