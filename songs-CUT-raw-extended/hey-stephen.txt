Taylor Swift

Hey, Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
