Taylor Swift 
2020

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles
'Til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it
'Til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you
