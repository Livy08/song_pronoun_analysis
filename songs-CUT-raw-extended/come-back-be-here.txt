Taylor Swift
2012

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here
