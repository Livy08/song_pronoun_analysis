Taylor Swift
2008

And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh
