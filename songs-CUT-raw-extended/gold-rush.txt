Taylor Swift 
2020

Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered 'round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
