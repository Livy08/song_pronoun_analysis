Taylor Swift
2012

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
