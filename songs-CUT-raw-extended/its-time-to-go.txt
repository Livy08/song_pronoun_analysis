Taylor Swift 
2020

When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go
