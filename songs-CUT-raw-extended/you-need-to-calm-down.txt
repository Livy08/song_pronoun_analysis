Taylor Swift 
2019

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patr√≥n
And I'm just like, "Damn!
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey!
Are you OK?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down"
